List (interface)

    -------->   1. ArrayList (class)
                2. LinkedList (class)

Basically every interface is implemented by many in-built classes, we can use them as follows:
interface_name <data_type> object_name = new class_name<>();
e.g: List<Integer> obj = new ArrayList<>();

Keep in mind that class_name should implement interface_name
as ArrayList implements List
